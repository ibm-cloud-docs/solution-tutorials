# Mobile application with a serverless backend

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} along with Cognitive and Data services to build a serverless backend for a mobile application.
{:shortdesc}

Not all mobile developers have experience managing server-side logic, or a server to start with. They would prefer to focus their efforts on the app they are building. Now what if they could reuse their existing development skills to write their mobile backend?

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} is a serverless event-driven platform. As [highlighted in this example](./serverless-api-webapp.html), the actions you deploy can easily be turned into HTTP endpoints as *web actions* to build a web application backend API. A web application being a client to the REST API, it is easy to take this example a step further and apply the same approach to build a backend for a mobile app. And with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, mobile developers can write the actions in the same language used for their mobile app, Java for Android, and Swift for iOS.

This tutorial is configurable based on your target platform. You are currently viewing the documentation for the **iOS / Swift** version of this tutorial. Use the drop down switcher at the top of this documentation to select the **Android / Java** version of this tutorial.

## Architecture
{: #architecture}

The application shown in this tutorial is a feedback app that smartly analyses the tone of the feedback text and appropriately acknowledges the customer through a {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}.

<p style="text-align: center;">
![](images/solution11/Architecture.png)
</p>

1. The user authenticates against [{{site.data.keyword.appid_short}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/AppID). {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} provides access and identification tokens.
2. Further calls to the backend API include the access token.
3. The backend is implemented with [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk). The serverless actions, exposed as Web Actions, expect the token to be sent in the request headers and verify its validity (signature and expiration date) before allowing access to the actual API.
4. When the user submits a feedback, the feedback is stored in [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudantNoSQLDB)
5. The feedback text is processed with [{{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone_analyzer).
6. Based on the analysis result, a notification is sent back to the user with [{{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/imfpush).
7. The user receives the notification on the device.

## Before you begin
{: #prereqs}

This tutorial uses the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command line tool to provision resources and deploy code. Make sure to install the `bx` command line tool.

{: swift}

## Provision services to handle user authentication, feedback persistence and analysis
{: #provision_services}

In this section, you will provision the services used by the application. You can choose to provision the services from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog or using the `bx` command line.

It is recommended that you create a new space to provision the services and deploy the serverless backend. This helps to keep all the resources together.

### Provision services from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog

1. Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/)
2. Create a [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudantNoSQLDB) service with the **Lite** plan. Set the name to **serverlessfollowup-db**.
3. Create a [{{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone_analyzer) service with the **Standard** plan. Set the name to **serverlessfollowup-tone**.
4. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.appid_short}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/AppID) service with the **Graduated tier** plan. Set the name to **serverlessfollowup-appid**.
5. Create a [{{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/imfpush) service with the **Lite** plan. Set the name to **serverlessfollowup-mobilepush**.

### Provision services from the command line

With the command line, run the following commands to provision the services and retrieve their credentials:

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Lite serverlessfollowup-db
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service-key serverlessfollowup-db for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf service-key serverlessfollowup-db for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service tone_analyzer standard serverlessfollowup-tone
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service-key serverlessfollowup-tone for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf service-key serverlessfollowup-tone for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service AppID "Graduated tier" serverlessfollowup-appid
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service-key serverlessfollowup-appid for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf service-key serverlessfollowup-appid for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service imfpush lite serverlessfollowup-mobilepush
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf create-service-key serverlessfollowup-mobilepush for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   bx cf service-key serverlessfollowup-mobilepush for-cli
   ```
   {: pre}

## Configure {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}
{: #push_notifications}

When a user submits a new feedback, the application will analyze this feedback and send back a notification to the user. The user may have moved to another task, or may not have the mobile app started so using push notifications is a good way to communicate with the user. The {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service makes it possible to send notifications to iOS or Android users via one unified API. In this section, you will configure the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service for your target platform.

### Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
{: java}

   1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), create a new project. Set the name to **serverlessfollowup**
   2. Navigate to the Project **Settings**
   3. Under the **General** tab, add two applications:
      1. one with the package name set to: **com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.push**
      2. and one with the package name set to: **serverlessfollowup.app**
   4. Download the `google-services.json` containing the two defined applications from Firebase console and place this file in the `android/app` folder of the checkout directory.
   5. Find the Sender ID and Server Key (also called API Key later on) under the **Cloud Messaging** tab.
   6. In the Push Notifications service dashboard, set the value of the Sender ID and API Key.
   {: java}

### Configure Apple Push Notifications Service (APNs)
{: swift}

1. Go to the [Apple Developer![External link icon](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/api/content/icons/launch-glyph.svg?lang=en?lang=en)](https://developer.apple.com/) portal and Register an App ID.
2. Create a development and distribution APNs SSL certificate.
3. Create a development provisioning profile.
4. Configure the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service instance on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Refer to [Obtain APNs credentials and configure {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/tutorials/ios-mobile-push-analytics.html#obtain-apns-credentials-and-configure-push-notifications-service-instance-) for detailed steps.
{: swift}

## Deploy a serverless backend
{: #serverless_backend}

With all the services configured, you can now deploy the serverless backend. The following {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} artifacts will be created in this section:

| Artifact                      | Type                           | Description                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `serverlessfollowup`          | Package                        | A package to group the actions and to keep all service credentials |
| `serverlessfollowup-cloudant` | Package Binding                | Bound to the built-in {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} package   |
| `serverlessfollowup-push`     | Package Binding                | Bound to the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} package  |
| `auth-validate`               | Action                         | Validates the access and identification tokens |
| `users-add`                   | Action                         | Persists the user information (id, name, email, picture, device id) |
| `users-prepare-notify`        | Action                         | Formats a message to use with {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} |
| `feedback-put`                | Action                         | Stores a user feedback in the database   |
| `feedback-analyze`            | Action                         | Analyzes a feedback with {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}}   |
| `users-add-sequence`          | Sequence exposed as Web Action | `auth-validate` and `users-add`          |
| `feedback-put-sequence`       | Sequence exposed as Web Action | `auth-validate` and `feedback-put`       |
| `feedback-analyze-sequence`   | Sequence                       | `read-document` from {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, `feedback-analyze`, `users-prepare-notify` and `sendMessage` with {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} |
| `feedback-analyze-trigger`    | Trigger                        | Called by {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} when a feedback is stored in the database |
| `feedback-analyze-rule`       | Rule                           | Links the trigger `feedback-analyze-trigger` with the sequence `feedback-analyze-sequence` |

### Compile the code
{: java}
1. From the root of the checkout directory, compile the actions code
{: java}

   ```sh
   ./android/gradlew -p actions clean jar
   ```
   {: pre}
   {: java}

### Configure and deploy the actions
{: java}

2. Copy template.local.env to local.env

   ```sh
   cp template.local.env local.env
   ```
3. Get the credentials for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}}, {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}
 and {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} services from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard (or the output of the bx commands we ran before) and replace placeholders in `local.env` with corresponding values. These properties will be injected into a package so that all actions can get access to the database.
4. Deploy the actions to {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. `deploy.sh` loads the credentials from `local.env` to create the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} databases (users, feedback and moods) and deploy the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} artifacts for the application.
   ```sh
   ./deploy.sh --install
   ```
   {: pre}

   You can use `./deploy.sh --uninstall` to remove the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} artifacts once you have completed the tutorial.
   {: tip}

## Configure and run a native mobile application to collect user feedback
{: #mobile_app}

Our {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} actions are ready for our mobile app. Before running the mobile app, you need to configure its settings to target the services you created.

1. With Android Studio, open the project located in the `android` folder of your checkout directory
2. Edit `android/app/src/main/res/values/credentials.xml` and fill in the blanks with values from credentials. You will need the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} `tenantId`, the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} `appGuid` and `clientSecret` and the organization and space names where the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} have been deployed.
3. Build the project
4. Start the application on a real device or with an emulator.
   For the emulator to receive push notifications, make sure to pick an image with the Google APIs and to log in with a Google account within the emulator.
   {: tip}
5. Watch the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} in the background
   ```sh
   bx wsk activation poll
   ```
   {: pre}
6. In the application, select **Log in** to authenticate with a Facebook or Google account. Once logged in, type a feedback message and press the **Send Feedback** button. Few seconds after the feedback has been sent, you should receive a push notifications on the device. The notification text can be customized by modifying the template documents in the `moods` database in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service instance. Use the **View token** button to inspect the access and identification tokens generated by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} upon login.
{: java}


1. Push client SDK and other SDKs are available on CocoaPods and Carthage. For this solution, let's use CocoaPods
2. Open Terminal and `cd ` into `followupapp` folder. Run the below command to install the required dependencies.
   ```sh
   pod install
   ```
   {: pre}
3. Open the file with  `.xcworkspace` extension located under the `followupapp` folder of your checkout directory to launch your code in Xcode.
4. Edit `BMSCredentials.plist file` and fill in the blanks with values from credentials. You will need the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} `tenantId`, the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} `appGuid` and `clientSecret` and the organization and space names where the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} have been deployed.
5. Build the project.
6. Start the application on a real device or with a simulator.
7. Watch the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} in the background by running the below command on a Terminal.
   ```sh
   bx wsk activation poll
   ```
   {: pre}
8. In the application, select **Log in** to authenticate with a Facebook or Google account. Once logged in, type a feedback message and press the **Send Feedback** button. Few seconds after the feedback has been sent, you should receive a push notifications on the device. The notification text can be customized by modifying the template documents in the `moods` database in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service instance. Use the **View token** button to inspect the access and identification tokens generated by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} upon login.
{: swift}

## Remove resources

1. Use `deploy.sh` to remove the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} artifacts:

   ```sh
   ./deploy.sh --uninstall
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Delete the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}}, {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} services from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

* {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} provides a default configuration to help with the initial set up of your identity providers. Prior to publishing your app, [update the configuration to your own credentials](../services/appid/identity-providers.html). You will also be able to [customize the login widget](../services/appid/login-widget.html#login-widget).


* When you create an OpenWhisk Swift action with a Swift source file(.swift files under `actions` folder), it has to be compiled into a binary before the action is run. Once done, subsequent calls to the action are much faster until the container that holds your action is purged. This delay is known as the cold-start delay.
  To avoid the cold-start delay, you can compile your Swift file into a binary and then upload to OpenWhisk in a zip file. As you need the OpenWhisk scaffolding, the easiest way to create the binary is to build it within the same environment it runs in. refer [Package an Action as a Swift executable](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/openwhisk/openwhisk_actions.html#creating-swift-actions) for further steps.
