This tutorial is deprecated and will be redirected soon. For users looking to deploy a VMware solution in VPC visit the documentation on [VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) on {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full_notm}}](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vpc-vcf-ovw). VMware Cloud Foundation in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is built on {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC) and the deployment is based on VMwareâ€™s best practices and architectural principles. {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is a highly resilient and highly secure software-defined network (SDN), where customers can build virtually isolated private clouds while maintaining public cloud benefits. You can also visit the [VMware Cloud Foundations order page](https://cloud.ibm.com/vmware/vcf/provision).
