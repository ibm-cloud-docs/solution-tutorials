### Import data
{: #create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model-import_data}

As mentioned earlier, you will be using the **Iris data set**. The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, _The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems_, and can also be found on the [UCI {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). This small dataset is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations. The aim is to classify Iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals. The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

![Iris Example](images/solution22-build-machine-learning-model/iris_machinelearning.png)

**Download** [iris_initial.csv](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ml-iris-classification/blob/master/data/iris_initial.csv) which consists of 40 instances of each species.

1. Under **Assets** in your project, click **New data asset** under **Data assets**.
2. Under **Load**, click on **browse** and upload the downloaded `iris_initial.csv`.
3. Once added, you should see `iris_initial.csv` under the **Data assets** section of the project. Click on the name to see the preview of the data set.

## Associate the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service
{: #create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model-associate_services}
{: step}

1. In the top navigation menu, click on `iris-project`, click on **Settings** in the top bar and scroll to **Associated Services** section.
2. Click **Add Service** and choose **{{site.data.keyword.watson}}**.

        "values": [
          [5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2], [3.2,1.2,5.2,1.7]
        ]
      }]
    }
   ```
   {:codeblock}
2. Click **Predict** and you should see the **Predictions** JSON output under **Result**.
3. You can change the input data and continue testing your model.

## Try out the API
{: #create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model-try_api}
{: step}

Along with the UI, you can also do predictions using the API scoring endpoint by exposing the deployed model as an API to be accessed from your applications.

1. Under **API reference** tab of the deployment, you can see the *Endpoint* under Direct link and code snippets in various programming languages.
2. **Copy** the *Endpoint* in a notepad for future reference.
3. In a browser, launch the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Shell](https://{DomainName}/shell) and export the scoring End-point to be used in subsequent requests. **_Make sure you don't close this window/tab_**..
   ```sh
   export SCORING_ENDPOINT='<SCORING_ENDPOINT_FROM_ABOVE_STEP>'
   ```
   {:pre}

   {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Shell is a cloud-based shell workspace that you can access through your browser. It's preconfigured with the full {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI and tons of plug-ins and tools that you can use to manage apps, resources, and infrastructure.
   {:tip}
4. To use the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} REST API, you need to obtain an [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) token. Run the below command
   ```sh
   ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens --output JSON | jq -r .iam_token
   ```
   {:pre}
5. Copy the complete IAM token along with `Bearer` from the above response and export it as an `IAM_TOKEN` to be used in the subsequent API requests
   ```sh
   export IAM_TOKEN='<IAM_TOKEN>'
   ```
   {:pre}
6. Run the below **cURL** code in the cloud shell to see the prediction results.
   ```sh
   curl -X POST \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --header 'Accept: application/json' \
   --header "Authorization: $IAM_TOKEN" \
   -d '{"input_data": [{"fields": ["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length","petal_width"],"values": [[5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2], [3.2,1.2,5.2,1.7]]}]}' \
   $SCORING_ENDPOINT
   ```
   {:pre}

   If you observe, the code is from the **cURL** tab of the deployment your created above. Thereafter, replacing the `[$ARRAY_OF_INPUT_FIELDS]` placeholder with  **["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length","petal_width"]**, `[$ARRAY_OF_VALUES_TO_BE_SCORED]` placeholder with **[5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2]** and `[$ANOTHER_ARRAY_OF_VALUES_TO_BE_SCORED]` placeholder with **[3.2,1.2,5.2,1.7]** respectively.
   {:tip}

## Monitor your deployed model with {{site.data.keyword.aios_full_notm}}
