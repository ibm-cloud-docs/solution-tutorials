### Import data
{: #create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model-import_data}

As mentioned earlier, you will be using the **Iris data set**. The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, _The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems_, and can also be found on the [UCI {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). This small dataset is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations. The aim is to classify Iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals. The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

![Iris Example](images/solution22-build-machine-learning-model/iris_machinelearning.png){: class="center"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**Download** [iris_initial.csv](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ml-iris-classification/blob/master/data/iris_initial.csv) which consists of 40 instances of each species.

1. Under **Assets** in your project, click **New data asset** under **Data assets**.
2. Under **Load**, click on **browse** and upload the downloaded `iris_initial.csv`.
3. Once added, you should see `iris_initial.csv` under the **Data assets** section of the project. Click on the name to see the preview of the data set.

## Associate the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service
{: #create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model-associate_services}
{: step}

1. In the top navigation menu, click on `iris-project`, click on **Settings** in the top bar and scroll to **Associated Services** section.
2. Click **Add Service** and choose **{{site.data.keyword.watson}}**.
3. If you have an existing **{{site.data.keyword.pm_short}}** service instance, skip to the next step. Otherwise continue with the following steps to create a new instance.
   1. Click **New service** on **{{site.data.keyword.pm_short}}** tile.
   2. Select a **region** same as the {{site.data.keyword.DSX_short}} service and choose a **Lite** plan.

6. The **AutoAI experiment** may take up to 5 minutes to select the right Algorithm for your model. Click on **Swap view** to see the Relationship map.

   Each model pipeline is scored for a variety of metrics and then ranked. The default ranking metric for binary classification models is the area under the ROC curve, for multi-class classification models is accuracy, and for for regression models is the root mean-squared error (RMSE). The highest-ranked pipelines are displayed in a leaderboard, so you can view more information about them. The leaderboard also provides the option to save select model pipelines after reviewing them.
   {: tip}

Once the experiment completes running, under the **Pipeline** leaderboard,
1. Click on **Pipeline comparison** to view how the top pipelines compare.
2. Sort the leaderboard by a different metric by selecting the **Rank by** dropdown
3. Click a pipeline to view more detail about the metrics and performance.

   Sorting by different metrics may not change the leaderboard rankings as the dataset used in this tutorial is very simple and used only for your understanding of the concepts. With other datasets, the rank may vary
   {: tip}

4. Next to the model with *Rank 1* when sorted by Accuracy, click on **Save as** > **Model**.
5. Check the details of the model and click **Create**.
6. From the received notification, click **View in project** then under **Overview** tab check the details of the model.

{: #create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model-7}

1. Under **Test** tab of your deployment, click on **Provide input data as JSON** icon next to **Enter input data** and provide the `JSON`below as input.
   ```json
      {
      "input_data": [{
        "fields": ["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length", "petal_width"],
        "values": [
          [5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2], [3.2,1.2,5.2,1.7]
        ]
      }]
    }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Click **Predict** and you should see the **Predictions** JSON output under **Result**.
3. You can change the input data and continue testing your model.

## Try out the API
{: #create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model-try_api}
{: step}

Along with the UI, you can also do predictions using the API scoring endpoint by exposing the deployed model as an API to be accessed from your applications.

1. Under **API reference** tab of the deployment, you can see the *Endpoint* under Direct link and code snippets in various programming languages.
2. **Copy** the *Endpoint* in a notepad for future reference.
3. In a browser, launch the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Shell](https://{DomainName}/shell) and export the scoring End-point to be used in subsequent requests. **_Make sure you don't close this window/tab_**..
   ```sh
   export SCORING_ENDPOINT='<SCORING_ENDPOINT_FROM_ABOVE_STEP>'
   ```
   {: pre}

   {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Shell is a cloud-based shell workspace that you can access through your browser. It's preconfigured with the full {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI and tons of plug-ins and tools that you can use to manage apps, resources, and infrastructure.
   {: tip}

4. To use the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} REST API, you need to obtain an [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) token. Run the below command
   ```sh
   ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens --output JSON | jq -r .iam_token
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Copy the complete IAM token along with `Bearer` from the above response and export it as an `IAM_TOKEN` to be used in the subsequent API requests
   ```sh
   export IAM_TOKEN='<IAM_TOKEN>'
   ```
   {: pre}

6. Run the below **cURL** code in the cloud shell to see the prediction results.
   ```sh
   curl -X POST \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --header 'Accept: application/json' \
   --header "Authorization: $IAM_TOKEN" \
   -d '{"input_data": [{"fields": ["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length","petal_width"],"values": [[5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2], [3.2,1.2,5.2,1.7]]}]}' \
   $SCORING_ENDPOINT
   ```
   {: pre}

   If you observe, the code is from the **cURL** tab of the deployment your created above. Thereafter, replacing the `[$ARRAY_OF_INPUT_FIELDS]` placeholder with  **["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length","petal_width"]**, `[$ARRAY_OF_VALUES_TO_BE_SCORED]` placeholder with **[5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2]** and `[$ANOTHER_ARRAY_OF_VALUES_TO_BE_SCORED]` placeholder with **[3.2,1.2,5.2,1.7]** respectively.
   {: tip}
