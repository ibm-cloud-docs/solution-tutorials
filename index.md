### [Deploy a secure web application across multiple regions](multi-region-webapp.html)

This tutorial is a walkthrough of how to create, secure, and deploy a web application across multiple regions using a continuous delivery pipeline.

Uses: Multiple Regions, Cloud Foundry, Node.js and Continous Delivery.

### [Scalable web app on Kubernetes](scalable-webapp-kubernetes.html)

This tutorial is a walkthrough of how to scaffold a Java web application, run it locally in a container and then deploy it to a IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, bind a custom domain, monitor the health of the environment and scale.

Uses: Docker, Kubernetees, Container Registry, and Java.

### [Accelerate delivery of static files using Object Storage and CDN](static-files-cdn.html)

Host and serve website assets (images, videos, documents) and user generated content in a Cloud Object Storage and use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast and secure delivery to users around the world.

Uses: Cloud Foundry, Node.js, Content Delivery Network, and Cloud Object Storage..

### [Web Application on LAMP Stack](lamp-stack.html)

This tutorial walks you through the creation of an Ubuntu Linux virtual server, with Apache web server, MySQL, and PHP (the LAMP stack). To see the LAMP server in action, you will install and configure the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) open source application.

Uses: Virtual Servers, PHP, WordPress and Vulnerability scanner.

### [Automate deployment of environments using Infrastructure as Code](infrastructure-as-code.html)

In this tutorial, you will use a provided template in Schematics to provision a Linux virtual server, with Apache web server, MySQL, and PHP server (LAMP stack) and Object Storage. You will then configure the template to scale the resources and tune the environment (memory, CPU and disk size). Finish by deleting all of the resources created by the configuration.

Uses: Schematics, Virtual Servers, PHP and Object Storage.

### [Modern Web Applications using MEAN stack](mean-stack.html)

This tutorial walks you through the creation of a web application using the popular MEAN stack. It is composed of a Mongo DB, Express web framework, Angular front end framework and a Node.js runtime.

Uses: Cloud Foundry, Node.js and Compose for MongoDB.

### [SQL Database for Cloud Data](sql-database.html)

This tutorial shows how to provision a SQL (relational) database service, create a table, and load a large data set (city information) into the database. Then, we deploy a web app "worldcities" to make use of that data and show how to access the cloud database.

Uses: Cloud Foundry, Python and Db2 Warehouse on the Cloud.

### [Serverless Web Application and API](serverless-api-webapp.html)

Create a serverless web application by hosting static website content in GitHub Pages and using Cloud Functions to implement the application backend.

Uses: Cloud Functions, API Gateway and Cloudant NoSQL DB.

### [Generate, Access and Analyze Application Logs](application-log-analysis.html)

Learn how the IBM Cloud Log Analysis service can be used to understand and diagnose activities of an app deployed in the IBM Cloud. Generate, search, analyze and visualize different log types using Elasticsearch and Kibana.

Uses: Cloud Foundry, Python, Log Analysis.

### [Create, Secure and Manage REST APIs](create-manage-secure-apis.html)

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a new REST API using the LoopBack Node.js API framework and then add management, visibility, security and rate limiting to your API using the API Connect service on IBM Cloud.

Uses: Cloud Foundry, Node.js and API Connect.
