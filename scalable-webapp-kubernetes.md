## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) installed on your machine
* [Container registry with namespace configured](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Registry/registry_setup_cli_namespace.html)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to interact with Kubernetes clusters
* [Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) Client and Tiller on cluster
* [bx dev tools](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloudnative/dev_cli.html#developercli)

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

The free cluster will allow you to deploy your application. However, to bind a custom domain to your cluster, you'll need to select a paid cluster option.

1. Create a cluster from the Bluemix console or with the `bx cs cluster-create` command.
2. Check the status of your cluster and wait for the cluster to be ready

### Configure kubectl to target your cluster

1. Once the cluster is ready, retrieve the cluster configuration

   ```
   bx cs cluster-config <cluster-name>
   ```

2. Export the KUBECONFIG environment variable

3. Check that the `kubectl` command is correctly configured

   ```
   kubectl cluster-info
   ```

### Initialize Helm for your cluster

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) helps you manage Kubernetes applications through Helm Charts â€” Helm Charts helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

## Create a starter Java application

The `bx dev` tooling greatly cuts down on development time by generating application starters with all the necessary boilerplate, build and configuration code, so that you can start coding business logic faster.

1. Start the `bx dev` wizard

   ```
   bx dev create
   ```

2. Select `Web App`

3. Select `Basic Web`

4. Select `Java - MicroProfile / JavaEE`

5. Enter a name for your project

6. Enter unique hostname for your project.

   > The hostname will be used if you deploy your application as a Cloud Foundry app <hostname>.mybluemix.net

7. Select **n** to skip adding services.

### Build the Java application

1. Ensure your local Docker engine is started

   ```
   docker ps
   ```

2. Change to the generated project directory

   ```
   cd <project name>
   ```

3. Build the application

   ```
   bx dev build
   ```

   > This might take a few minutes to run as all the application dependencies are downloaded and a *Docker image* is built which contains your application and all the required environment.

### Run the Java application

1. Run the application locally

   ```
   bx dev run
   ```

   > This will use your local Docker engine to run the docker image built by the previous step.

2. Once your container starts, visit http://localhost:9080/[nameofproject]

## Deploy application to cluster

In this section, we will first push the Docker image to the IBM Cloud private container registry, and then create a Kubernetes deployment pointing to that image.

1. Find your **namespace** by listing all the namespace in the registry.

   ```
   bx cr namespaces
   ```
   If you don't have one, create it.

   ```
   bx cr namespace-add <name>
   ```

2. Find the **Container Registry** by running

   ```
   bx cr info
   ```
   to find the container registry

3. Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```
   bx dev deploy -t container
   ```

4. You will be prompted to enter **image name**.

   Image name will be in the following format: `<registry_url>/<namespace>/<projectname>`

   For example: `registry.ng.bluemix.net/mynamespace/myjavawebapp`

5. Next, you will be prompted to enter your **cluster name**.

6. Wait a few minutes for your application to be deployed.

7. Retrieve the **public IP** of your cluster workers

   ```
   bx cs workers <your-cluster>
   OK
   ID                                                 Public IP        Private IP      Machine Type   State    Status
   kube-dal12-cr4a8d8f9f64dedededededdwwdec69a72-w1   169.21.32.14   10.184.220.82   u1c.2x4        normal   Ready
   ```

8. Retrieve the **port** assigned to your application

   ```
   kubectl get services
   ```

   and locate your service in the list:
   ```
   NAME                    CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE
   myjavawebapp-service   10.10.10.17   <nodes>       9080:32321/TCP,9443:31555/TCP   2m
   kubernetes              10.10.10.1    <none>        443/TCP                         1d
   ```

   alternatively you can use `kubectl describe service [service-name]`. In this example, the port is 32321.

9. Access the application

   ```
   http://worker-ip-address:portnumber/nameofproject
   ```

## Use the IBM-provided domain for your cluster

In the previous step, the application was accessed with a not standard port. The service was exposed via Kubernetes NodePort feature.

Paid clusters come with an IBM-provided domain. This gives you a better option to expose applications with a proper URL and on standard HTTP/S ports.

**TODO: Describe Ingress here**

1. Identify your IBM-provided **Ingress domain**

   ```
   bx cs cluster-get <cluster-name>
   ```

   to find

   ```
   Ingress subdomain:	mycluster.us-south.containers.mybluemix.net
   Ingress secret:		mycluster
   ```

2. Create an Ingress file `ingress-ibmdomain.yml` pointing to your domain with support for HTTP and HTTPS. Use the following file as a template, replacing all the values wrapped in <>.

   ```
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: ingress-for-ibmdomain-http-and-https
   spec:
     tls:
     - hosts:
       -  <ingress-sub-domain>
       secretName: <ingress-secret>
     rules:
     - host: <ingress-sub-domain>
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           backend:
             serviceName: <service-name>
             servicePort: 9080
   ```

3. Deploy the Ingress

   ```
   kubectl apply -f ingress-ibmdomain.yml
   ```

4. Access your application at `https://<ingress-sub-domain>/<nameofproject>`

## Use your own domain

To use your custom domain, you need to update your DNS records with either a CNAME record pointing to your IBM-provided domain or an A record pointing to the portable public IP address of the IBM-provided Ingress. Given a paid cluster comes with fixed IP addresses, an A record is a good option.

Refer to https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_apps.html#custom_domain_cert

### with HTTP

1. Create an Ingress file `ingress-customdomain-http.yml` pointing to your domain:

   ```
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
    metadata:
     name: ingress-for-customdomain-http
   spec:
     rules:
     - host: <my-custom-domain.com>
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           backend:
             serviceName: <service-name>
             servicePort: 9080
   ```

2. Deploy the Ingress

   ```
   kubectl apply -f ingress-customdomain-http.yml
   ```

3. Access your application at `http://<customdomain>/<nameofproject>`

### with HTTPS

If you were to try to access your application with HTTPS at this time `https://<customdomain>/<nameofproject>`, you will likely get a security warning from your web browser telling you the connection is not private. You would also get a 404 as the Ingress we just configured would not know how to direct HTTPS traffic.

1. Obtain a trusted SSL certificate for your domain. You'll need the certificate and the key:
  https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_apps.html#custom_domain_cert

   > You can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to generate trusted certificate. [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com) makes it easy to go through the Let's Encrypt process.

2. Save the cert and the key in base64 ascii format files.

3. Create a TLS secret to store the cert and the key

   ```
   kubectl create secret tls my-custom-domain-secret-name --cert=<custom-domain.cert> --key=<custom-domain.key>
   ```

4. Create an Ingress file `ingress-customdomain-https.yml` pointing to your domain:

   ```
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: ingress-customdomain-https
   spec:
     tls:
     - hosts:
       - <my-custom-domain.com>
       secretName: <my-custom-domain-secret-name>
     rules:
     - host: <my-custom-domain.com>
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           backend:
             serviceName: <service-name>
             servicePort: 9080
   ```

5. Deploy the Ingress

   ```
   kubectl apply -f ingress-customdomain-https.yml
   ```

6. Access your application at `https://<customdomain>/<nameofproject>`

## Monitor application health

1. Use the **Kubernetes console** to watch your application health

   ```
   kubectl proxy
   ```

   then access the console at http://127.0.0.1:8001/ui

2. Select **Nodes** and see the **Allocation Resources** to see the health of your nodes.

## Scale Kubernetes pods

As load increase you can manually scale the number of pods in your application deployment.

To scale to 2 replicas, run the following command.

   ```
   kubectl scale deployment <nameofproject>-deployment --replicas=2
   ```

Ingress will handle the load balancing between the two replicas.

Refer to Kubernetes documentation for manual and automatic scaling:

   * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment
   * https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/
