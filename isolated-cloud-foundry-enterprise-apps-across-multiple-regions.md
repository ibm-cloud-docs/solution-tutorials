## Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment

With IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment (CFEE) you can instantiate multiple, isolated, enterprise-grade Cloud Foundry platforms on-demand. Instances of the IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise service run within your own account in the IBM Cloud. The environment is deployed on isolated hardware (Kubernetes clusters). You have full control over the environment, including access control, capacity, version updates, resource usage and monitoring. Furthermore, CFEE integration into the IBM Cloud allows developers to leverage services available in their IBM Cloud account. Users can add those services to a CFEE and bind them to applications deployed into CFEE spaces.
