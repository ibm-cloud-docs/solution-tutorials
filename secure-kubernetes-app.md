# Leverage security services for a Kubernetes app
The solution features an app that enables groups of users to upload files to a common storage pool and provide access to those files via shareable links. The app is written in Node.js and deployed as Docker container to the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}. It leverages several security-related services and features to improve app security.

1. The user does this
2. Then that

## Before you begin
{: #prereqs}

* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Install {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html#getting-started)

## Create services
{: setup}

rough outline
* Prepare org and space
* Deploy Activity Tracker (no config necessary..?)
* create K8S cluster, takes a while...
* Deploy Key Protect
* create your own key (how?), import as root key into KP
* deploy COS (no config needed?)
* deploy Cloudant
* deploy App ID, config login page
* git clone the repo
* configure and push app, how much config can be done automatically?
* configure App ID, set redirect page (could be don from within code)
* optional: custom domain, deploy CM, deploy cert to cluster, config ingress


In this section, you will create the services required to ...

1. Login to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} via the command line and target your Cloud Foundry account. See [CLI Getting Started](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html#getting-started).
    ```sh
    ibmcloud login
    ```
    {: pre}
    ```sh
    ibmcloud target --cf
    ```
    {: pre}
2. Create an instance of [Service A](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/the-service-name).
  ```sh
  ibmcloud resource service-instance-create service-instance-name service-name lite global
  ```
3. Create an instance of [Service B](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/the-service-name).

## Solution Specific Section
{: #section_one}

Introductory statement that overviews the section

1. Step 1 Click **This** and enter your name.

  This is a tip.
  {:tip}

2. Keep each step as short as possible.
3. Do not use blank lines between steps except for tips or images.
4. *Avoid* really long lines like this one explaining a concept inside of a step. Do not offer optional steps or FYI inside steps. *Avoid* using "You can do ...". Be prescriptive and tell them exactly what to do succinctly, like a lab.
5. Do not use "I", "We will", "Let's", "We'll", etc.
6. Another step
7. Try to limit to 7 steps.
