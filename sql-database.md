# SQL Database for Cloud Data 

To build a new cloud app I need to store relational data. I need to select a SQL database, set it up, load data, bind it to my app. The database needs to have some security and I need to monitor it once the app is in production.

## Objectives

* Pick an SQL database service
* Create SQL database
* Create the schema
* Load initial data
* Connect the app to the database (share credentials)
* Secure the SQL database
* Monitoring
* (Discuss) Backups & Recovery
