## Account and Enterprise in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} 
{: #account-enterprise-settings}

This checklist is for administrators responsible for creating and setting up an account structure in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and enable users within their company to create and/or manage cloud resources.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offers you the ability to create a stand-alone account and/or an Enterprise.

A stand-alone account allows account owner(s), for example department or business unit administrators, to add users to the account, manage roles and permissions, manage billing and payments, and much more.

An enterprise manages the billing for the entire company, with usage costs from multiple accounts being rolled up and paid from the enterprise account. Accounts that are created as part of an enterprise are just like stand-alone {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts, the main difference is that these accounts don't manage their own billing or payments.

Use the following checklist to track all the tasks to create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and/or enterprise. 

| | Description |
|-|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **What's in an account?**: Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account includes many interacting components and systems for resource, user, and access management. Concepts like how certain components are connected or how access works help you in understanding how to set up your account. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-overview).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Determine if you need an Enterprise**. \n Once you create an enterprise to manage your billing, you can move existing stand-alone accounts to it or create new accounts as needed. Consider the following when determining if you need an enterprise or a stand-alone account: \n * In an enterprise, subscription discounts and cloud credits are available to all accounts that are in the enterprise. \n  * Stand-alone account control their own billing. If your company is globally distributed, you may have a mix of multiple enterprises and/or stand-alone accounts to support regional billing requirements. \n \n Learn more by visiting the [What is an enterprise?](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui) topic to determine if you need an enterprise.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account**. \n Even if you plan on using an enterprise, you need to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. You can create your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account by going to the [account registration](https://{DomainName}/registration) page and provide your e-mail address and some additional information. The e-mail address used becomes the account owner, you can change this if required later on by following the [Transferring ownership of your account](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-transfer&interface=ui). \n \n When you log in to the account for the first time, you are required to provide a credit card or subscription code to complete your account setup. Later on, you will be able to add users by inviting them to the account or by federating to your own corporate directory. \n \n Users that are added to your account are not required to created their own account. \n \n For more account related FAQs visit [managing your account, resources, and access](https://{DomainName}/docs?tab=faqs&tags=account). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Setup SAML federation**. \n When you create an account in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, by default for user identity you use an IBMid. IBMid is the ID as a Service (IDaaS) from IBM used to access IBM web based services, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. The IBMid is based on your company's email address and a password managed by IBMid. IBMid allows you to federate to your own corporate directory or a 3rd party Identity Provider (IdP) service that you may already be using such as Okta. \n \n Federating to your own directory simplifies the process of adding users to your account as they will not require an IBMid and manage a separate password. However, there are cases that it may not be feasible for you to use IBMid federated to your corporate directory. \n \n An alternative is to create an [{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/app-id) instance in your account and connect it to your desired identity provider. \n \n It is possible that your company's domain is already federated with IBMid, review the following decision flow diagram to understand if it is and help you in deciding your best path. \n \n ![IBMid-AppID-FederatedIdP-DecisionFlow](images/checklist-hidden/IBMid-AppID-FederatedIdP-DecisionFlow.svg){: caption="Figure 1. IBMid Federation Decision Flow" caption-side="bottom"}  \n \n Consider the following options that are available to you: \n * **Option A - Login to IBM services (`*.ibm.com`) and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} (`{DomainName}`) using IBMid**: Your company email domain is not federated with IBMid and you choose to keep it as is. Any user using your email domain can create their own IBMid and the password they create is managed by IBMid. They can invite other users with an IBMid to their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. \n * **Option B - Login to IBM services (`*.ibm.com`) and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} (`{DomainName}`) using IBMid that is federated to your IdP**: If your company's email domain is already federated, you can start configuring access to your account. If it is not already federated, a manual process with the IBMid federation team is required in order to establish federation. The decision to federate to your company's own directory needs to involve the person in your company that can make company wide decisions when it comes to connecting to external parties for identity services, you need to ensure this person is included the process. Federating with IBMid can have an impact on web services that your company already utilizes with IBM. \n * **Option C - Login to IBM services (`*.ibm.com`) using IBMid federated to an IdP and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} (`{DomainName}`) using a different federated IdP**: This option requires the creation on an {{site.data.keyword.appid_long_notm}} instance, it is a self-service option with a low usage feed. Choosing this option will require a custom URL to login to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. In addition, an {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} instance instance and configuration of the federation to your IdP is required for every {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. \n \n For a deeper dive, use the following guides and documentation topics:  \n \n * [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SAML Federation Guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-saml-federation-guide)  \n \n * [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} login sequences](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#signup-federated). \n \n Use the following documentation topics when you are ready to federate: \n [IBMid Enterprise Federation Adoption Guide](https://ibm.box.com/v/IBMid-Federation-Guide) \n \n [Enable authentication from an external identity provider using {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-idp-integration). \n \n  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Activate a subscription code**. \n With an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} subscription, you get discounted usage for platform services and support by committing to a minimum spending commitment for a certain period of time. After you buy a subscription for platform or support credit, you must add the credit to your account by applying a subscription code to your stand-alone account or enterprise account. Applying the code ensures that the credit is added to your account and you don't have unexpected overage charges. Make sure to add any purchased subscriptions to your account prior to creating resources. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscription_code).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create and configure an enterprise**. \n When you create an enterprise, the account that you used to initiate the process is automatically added to the enterprise and a new enterprise account is created to manage the billing for the enterprise. Follow the steps in the [Setting up an enterprise](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-tutorial) topic to create an enterprise. Keep in mind when using an enterprise, users within each account in the enterprise can create, use, and collaborate on resources just as they can in a stand-alone account.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg) | **Assign enterprise access to users**. \n If you opted to create an enterprise, you may require to have administrators manage the enterprise performing functions such as creating account groups, creating and managing accounts. Review the access level required and add users as appropriate. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-enterprise&interface=ui).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create Resource Groups**. \n Use resource groups to organize an account's resources for access control and billing purposes. For example, creating a resource group per project allows costs to be tracked at the project level even when your resources are distributed across regions. \n Learn more from the [Best practices guide](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#resource-group-strategy) and when you are ready, [create your resource group(s)](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-rgs).  |

## Secure your account and resources
{: #securing}

| | Description |
|-|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Setup Multi-factor Authentication**. \n Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring all users to authenticate by using an additional authentication factor beyond an ID and password. This is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA). \n Review the [types of multifactor authentication](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-types&interface=ui) that can be enabled for your account. \n Follow the steps in [enabling MFA for your account](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-enablemfa&interface=ui) to configure the setting that is most appropriate for your company.|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Overview** \n Learn about what {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) is, how IAM works, what features are available, and how to access the console, CLI, and APIs to work with IAM in your account. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Track your account activities by setting up an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance**. \n You can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you have provisioned. Follow the instructions in [Provisioning an {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance](https://{DomainName}/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision) to create an instance in your desired cloud region.  \n \n For environments seeking to maintain **Financial Services Validated** status on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} should instead follow the instructions in to [Use Activity Tracker Event Routing](https://{DomainName}/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started-routing-2). \n \n You **must** create an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service in the Frankfurt (eu-de) region to start tracking IAM events.  [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-acct_iam_tracking) on the events that are sent to that region. Follow the instructions in [Provisioning an {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance](https://{DomainName}/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision) to create an instance in Frankfurt (eu-de). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Configure streaming of {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} (optional)**. \n You can stream data from an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} another {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} across region or to other corporate tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-streaming).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg) | **Secure your resources with context-based restrictions**. \n Context-based restrictions give account owners and administrators the ability to define and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources based on the network location of access requests. These restrictions work with traditional IAM policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials. \n [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis) and follow the guide to [secure your resources using context-based restrictions](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-tutorial). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Which data protection service is best for me**. \n With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can choose from various secrets management and data protection offerings that help you to protect your sensitive data and centralize your secrets. Review the following [table](https://{DomainName}/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manage-secrets-ibm-cloud#which-data-protection-service) to better understand the different offerings that you can use with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to protect your application secrets. Use the following guides to create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance: \n * [Store your secrets in a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance](https://{DomainName}/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-create-instance&interface=ui). \n * [Encrypt your data with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](https://{DomainName}/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-provision).  \n * [Encrypt your data with {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}](https://{DomainName}/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-provision&interface=ui). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Security and compliance**: {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides a secure cloud platform that you can trust. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} compliance results from a platform and services that are built on best-in-industry security standards, including GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, PCI, SOC2, and others.  [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/overview?topic=overview-compliance). |

## Connect your network to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #network}

Use the following checklist to review the options available and to connect your existing on-premises environment(s) to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
| | Description |
|-|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Enable Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)**. \n Dispersed cloud resources are resources in more than one location or in more than one subnet or VLAN. These types of resources require a routing function to communicate among themselves, even within a private network context. New accounts created in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} will have a "multiple isolation" tenancy communication option, which is often called a customer VRF, enabled. Verify that it is enabled in your account - or enable it after confirming potential service disruptions if you have existing resources in your account - by following the steps outlined in this [documentation topic](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#vrf).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Enable Service Endpoints**. \n It is also recommended to enable your account for using service endpoints. When {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoints are enabled in your account, you can choose to expose a private network endpoint when you create a resource. You can then connect directly to this endpoint over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network rather than the public network. Because resources that use private network endpoints don't have an internet-routable IP address, connections to these resources are more secure. Follow the steps outlined in this [documentation topic](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#use-service-endpoint). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Determine the Interconnectivity solution for you**. \n Virtual Private Networking (VPN) access enables you to manage all servers and services that are associated with your account, remotely, over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. Depending on the infrastructure you plan on using in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} there are a few options available for VPN: \n * [VPN for classic infrastructure](https://{DomainName}/docs/iaas-vpn?topic=iaas-vpn-getting-started). \n * [Client-to-site VPN for VPC infrastructure](https://{DomainName}/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview). \n * [Site-to-site VPN for VPC infrastructure](https://{DomainName}/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn). \n \n {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} is an alternative to a traditional site-to-site VPN solution, it can provide higher-throughput connectivity between a remote network and IBM Cloud environments. Use this decision tree to help you decide which {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} solution works best for you. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link#get-started-solution-to-order).    |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **About {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} (2.0)**. \n {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} offerings provide connectivity from an external source into a customer's {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} can be viewed as an alternative to a traditional site-to-site VPN solution, which is designed for customers that need more consistent, higher-throughput connectivity between a remote network and their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environments. When selecting to use {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}, it is recommended that most customers choose {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 2.0.  [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about).   |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Order {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Dedicated**. \n Allows customers to terminate a single-tenant, fiber-based cross-connect into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network. This offering can be used by customers with colocation premises that are next to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} PoPs and data centers, as well as network service providers that deliver circuits to customer on-premises or other data centers. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-dedicated).   |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Order {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect**. \n Offers private access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure and to any other clouds linked to your service provider through your local {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center. This option is perfect for creating multi-cloud connectivity in a single environment. IBM connects customers to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network, using a shared bandwidth topology. As with all {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} products, you can add global routing that enables private network traffic to all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} locations. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-connect).   |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Identify potential conflicts with the IBM Network Reserved IPs (Applicable to {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 1.0 only)**. \n When selecting to use {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}, it is recommended that most customers choose {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 2.0 since it provides more options and flexibility.  If you have a real need for {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 1.0, make sure to review the list of IBM Network Reserved IPs that may conflict with your on-premises environment. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).    |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Coordinate with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Design Engineering when you have special requirements**. \n If you are planning on using  any of the following:  GRE or IPSec tunnels, BCR pairing,  multi VLAN tenants, custom inbound or outbound ACLs, ASN pre-pend, and static routes, open a Support ticket and request assistance from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Design Engineering to confirm your requirements are inline with your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} selections.  |

## Enable observability (logging and monitoring)
{: #observability}

| | Description |
|-|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)   | **Create platform logs**. \n  You can use {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} to manage operating system logs, application logs, and platform logs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Platform logs are logs that are exposed by enabled services and the platform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You must configure a logging instance in a region to monitor these logs. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create dedicated logging instance (optional)**. \n {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers advanced features to filter, search, and tail log data, define alerts, and design custom views to monitor application and system logs. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-getting-started). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Configure streaming of {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}**. \n You can stream data from an {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} another {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} across region or to other corporate tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-streaming).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Configure logging agent**. \n The logging agent collects and forwards logs to your {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} instance. After you provision an {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} instance, you must configure a logging agent for each log source that you want to monitor.

## Users and access groups
{: #users-groups}

|| Description |
|-|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create Access Groups**. \n Access groups are used to organize a set of users and service IDs into a single entity to enable the assignment of policies to the group instead of assigning the same access multiple times per individual user or service ID. A logical way to assign access to resource groups is by creating one access group per required level of access. Then each access group is mapped to the needed resource groups. Examples of access groups you should consider would be Admin and Developer. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#accessgroup_strategy).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Configure access groups for {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}}**. \n You can configure, control, and manage events and logging data that is available to users by configuring groups in the logging instance. Groups provide additional security by only allowing users to see a subset of auditing events, as opposed to all auditing events that are generated in the account. For example, you could grant a group of users access to only see auditing events that are related to development services in the account. Learn more by reviewing the following documentation topics: [Using groups to control data access](https://{DomainName}/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-group_data_access) & [RBAC, groups and IAM integration](https://{DomainName}/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-iam_grant_group).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Manage resource groups**. \n A resource group is a way for you to organize your account resources in customizable groupings so that you can quickly assign users access to multiple resources at a time. It is generally recommended to create a resource group per project. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-rgs&interface=ui).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Invite users to your account**. \n Users are invited to an account and given access to the resources in the account. Use IAM to invite users, cancel invitations, or resend a pending invitation. You can invite a single user or multiple users. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-iamuserinv&interface=ui).  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Trusted Profiles**. \n Trusted profiles are used to automatically grant federated users access to your account with conditions based on SAML attributes from your corporate directory. Trusted profiles can also be used to set up fine-grained authorization for applications that are running in compute resources. This way, you aren't required to create service IDs or API keys for the compute resources. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile&interface=ui). |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | A service ID identifies a service or application similar to how a user ID identifies a user. You can create a service ID and use it to enable an application outside of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} access to resources in your account. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids&interface=ui) |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  |**Policy**. \n A policy consists of a subject, target, and a role. A policy grants a subject one or multiple roles to a set of resources so that specific actions can be taken. The role defines the level of access that is granted. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/account?topic=account-iamusermanpol). |
