## Account and Enterprise in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} 
{: #account-enterprise-settings}

This checklist is for administrators responsible for creating and setting up an account structure in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and enable users within their company to create and/or manage cloud resources.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offers you the ability to create a stand-alone account and/or an Enterprise.

A stand-alone account allows account owner(s), for example department or business unit administrators, to add users to the account, manage roles and permissions, manage billing and payments, and much more. It includes the following interacting components:
   * **Users**: Users are invited to an account and given access to the resources in the account.
   * **Access Groups**: Access groups are used to organize a set of users and service IDs into a single entity to enable the assignment of policies to the group instead of assigning the same access multiple times per individual user or service ID.
   * **Resource Groups**: Resource groups are used to organize an account's cloud resources into groupings so that users can be given access to more than one resource at a time. 
   * **Policy**: A policy consists of a subject, target, and a role. A policy grants a subject one or multiple roles to a set of resources so that specific actions can be taken. The role defines the level of access that is granted. 
   * **Trusted Profiles**: Trusted profiles are used to automatically grant federated users access to your account with conditions based on SAML attributes from your corporate directory. Trusted profiles can also be used to set up fine-grained authorization for applications that are running in compute resources. This way, you aren't required to create service IDs or API keys for the compute resources.

An enterprise manages the billing for the entire company, with usage costs from multiple accounts being rolled up and paid from the enterprise account. Accounts that are created as part of an enterprise are just like stand-alone {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts, the main difference is that these accounts don't manage their own billing or payments.

Use the following checklist to track all the tasks to create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and/or enterprise. 

| | Description |
|-|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Determine if you need an Enterprise**. \n An **Enterprise** manages billing for your entire company, with usage costs from the accounts that are added to the enterprise rolled up and paid from the enterprise account. Once you create an enterprise to manage your billing, you can move existing stand-alone accounts to it or create new accounts as needed. Consider the following when determining if you need an enterprise or a stand-alone account: \n * In an enterprise, subscription discounts and cloud credits are available to all accounts that are in the enterprise. \n  * Stand-alone account control their own billing. If your company is globally distributed, you may have a mix of multiple enterprises and/or stand-alone accounts to support regional billing requirements. \n \n Learn more by visiting the [What is an enterprise?](/docs/account?topic=account-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui){: external} topic to determine if you need an enterprise. \n *Note: A subscription or committed use billing model is required to create an enterprise*.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account**. \n Even if you plan on using an enterprise, you need to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. You can create your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account by going to [https://{DomainName}/registration](https://{DomainName}/registration){: external} and provide your e-mail address and some additional information. \n When you log in to the account for the first time, you are required to provide a credit card or subscription code to complete your account setup. Later on, you will be able to add users by inviting them to the account or by federating to your own corporate directory. \n \n Users that are added to your account are not required to created their own {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Determine if you will use an IBMid or a federated identity to add users to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account**. \n When you create an account in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, by default for user identity you use an IBMid. IBMid is the ID as a Service (IDaaS) from IBM used to access IBM web based services, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. The IBMid is based on your company's email address and a password managed by IBMid. IBMid allows you to federate to your own corporate directory or a 3rd party Identity Provider (IdP) service that you may already be using such as Okta. \n \n Federating to your own directory simplifies the process of adding users to your account as they will not required to create an IBMid and manage a separate password. However, there are cases that it may not be feasible for you to use IBMid federated to your corporate directory. \n \n An alternative is to create an [{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/app-id){: external} instance in your account and connect it to your desired identity provider. \n \n It is possible that your company's domain is already federated with IBMid, review the following decision flow diagram to understand if it is and help you in deciding your best path. (You can click on the image to expand it) \n \n [![IBMid-AppID-FederatedIdP-DecisionFlow](images/checklist-hidden/IBMid-AppID-FederatedIdP-DecisionFlow.svg){: caption="Figure 1. IBMid-AppID-FederatedIdP-DecisionFlow" caption-side="bottom"}](/docs-content/v1/content/5779af531dd5cb8abe32792fd23a193c46c3cb41/solution-tutorials/images/checklist-hidden/IBMid-AppID-FederatedIdP-DecisionFlow.svg)  \n \n Consider the following options that are available to you: \n * **Option A - Login to IBM services (`*.ibm.com`) and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} (`{DomainName}`) using IBMid**: Your company email domain is not federated with IBMid and you choose to keep it as is. Any user using your email domain can create their own IBMid and the password they create is managed by IBMid. They can invite other users with an IBMid to their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. \n * **Option B - Login to IBM services (`*.ibm.com`) and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} (`{DomainName}`) using IBMid that is federated to your IdP**: If your company's email domain is already federated, you can start configuring access to your account. If it is not already federated, a manual process with the IBMid federation team is required in order to establish federation. The decision to federate to your company's own directory needs to involve the person in your company that can make company wide decisions when it comes to connecting to external parties for identity services, you need to ensure this person is included the process. Federating with IBMid can have an impact on web services that your company already utilizes with IBM. \n * **Option C - Login to IBM services (`*.ibm.com`) using IBMid federated to an IdP and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} (`{DomainName}`) using a different federated IdP**: This option requires the creation on an {{site.data.keyword.appid_long_notm}} instance, it is a self-service option with a low usage feed. Choosing this option will require a custom URL to login to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. In addition, an {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} instance instance and configuration of the federation to your IdP is required for every {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. \n \n For a deeper dive, use the following guides and documentation topics:  \n \n * [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SAML Federation Guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-saml-federation-guide){: external}  \n \n * [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} login sequences](/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#signup-federated). \n \n Use the following documentation topics when you are ready to federate: \n [IBMid Enterprise Federation Adoption Guide](https://ibm.box.com/v/IBMid-Federation-Guide){: external} \n \n [Enabling authentication from an external identity provider using {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}](/docs/account?topic=account-idp-integration){: external}. \n \n  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Activate a subscription code**. \n With an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} subscription, you get discounted usage for platform services and support by committing to a minimum spending commitment for a certain period of time. After you buy a subscription for platform or support credit, you must add the credit to your account by applying a subscription code to your stand-alone account or enterprise account. Applying the code ensures that the credit is added to your account and you don't have unexpected overage charges. Make sure to add any purchased subscriptions to your account prior to creating resources. [Learn more](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscription_code){: external}.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create and configure an enterprise**. \n When you create an enterprise, the account that you used to initiate the process is automatically added to the enterprise and a new enterprise account is created to manage the billing for the enterprise. Follow the steps in the [Setting up an enterprise](/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-tutorial){: external} topic to create an enterprise. Keep in mind when using an enterprise, users within each account in the enterprise can create, use, and collaborate on resources just as they can in a stand-alone account.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg) | **Assign enterprise access to users**. \n If you opted to create an enterprise, you may require to have administrators manage the enterprise performing functions such as creating account groups, creating and managing accounts. Review the access level required and add users as appropriate. [Learn more](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-enterprise&interface=ui){: external}.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Create Resource Groups**. \n Use resource groups to organize an account's resources for access control and billing purposes. For example, creating a resource group per project allows costs to be tracked at the project level even when your resources are distributed across regions. \n  ![resource-groups-cross-regions](images/checklist-hidden/resource-groups-cross-regions.svg) \n \n Learn more from the [Best practices guide](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#resource-group-strategy){: external} and when you are ready, [create your resource group(s)](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs){: external}.  |

You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions, and comply with regulatory audit requirements. Depending on your compliance and organizational requirements, you will need to select between two {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Activity Tracker offerings. [Learn more](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-about){: external}. \n In {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}, events are collected automatically for most Activity Tracker Event Routing-enabled services. However, some services might require an upgrade of the service plan, a configuration setting, or both, for you to be able to collect and analyze their events. [Learn more](https://{DomainName}/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-events_collect){: external}. |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Provision an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance**. \n You can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you have provisioned. Follow the instructions in [Provisioning an {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision){: external} to create an instance in your desired cloud region.  \n For environments seeking to maintain **Financial Services Validated** status on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} should instead follow the instructions in to [Use Activity Tracker Event Routing](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started-routing-2){: external}. |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Provision an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance for IAM events**. \n You can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, private catalogs, and with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). These services, send all of their events to the Frankfurt (eu-de) region. You **must** create an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service in the Frankfurt (eu-de) region to start tracking IAM events.  [Learn more](/docs/account?topic=account-acct_iam_tracking){: external} on the events that are sent to that region.

## Connecting your network to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #network}

Use the following checklist to review the options available and to connect your existing on-premises environment(s) to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
| | Description |
|-|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Enable Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)**. \n Dispersed cloud resources are resources in more than one location or in more than one subnet or VLAN. These types of resources require a routing function to communicate among themselves, even within a private network context. New accounts created in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} will have a "multiple isolation" tenancy communication option, which is often called a customer VRF, enabled. Verify that it is enabled in your account - or enable it after confirming potential service disruptions if you have existing resources in your arccount - by following the steps outlined in this [documentation topic](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#vrf){: external}.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Enable Service Endpoints**. \n It is also recommended to enable your account for using service endpoints. When {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoints are enabled in your account, you can choose to expose a private network endpoint when you create a resource. You can then connect directly to this endpoint over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network rather than the public network. Because resources that use private network endpoints don't have an internet-routable IP address, connections to these resources are more secure. Follow the steps outlined in this [documentation topic](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#use-service-endpoint){: external}. |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Determine the Interconnectivity solution for you**. \n Use this decision tree to help you decide which solution works best for you. If you want help with getting started, you can open an IBM Support case through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, or contact your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} sales representative. [Learn more](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link#get-started-solution-to-order){: external}.    |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **About {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link (2.0)**. \n {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link offerings provide connectivity from an external source into a customer's {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. Direct Link can be viewed as an alternative to a traditional site-to-site VPN solution, which is designed for customers that need more consistent, higher-throughput connectivity between a remote network and their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environments. When selecting to use Direct Link, it is recommended that most customers choose Direct Link 2.0.  [Learn more](/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about){: external}.   |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link Dedicated**. \n Allows customers to terminate a single-tenant, fiber-based cross-connect into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network. This offering can be used by customers with colocation premises that are next to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} PoPs and data centers, as well as network service providers that deliver circuits to customer on-premises or other data centers. [Learn more](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-dedicated){: external}.   |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link Connect**. \n Offers private access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure and to any other clouds linked to your service provider through your local {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center. This option is perfect for creating multi-cloud connectivity in a single environment. IBM connects customers to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network, using a shared bandwidth topology. As with all Direct Link products, you can add global routing that enables private network traffic to all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} locations. [Learn more](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-connect){: external}.   |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Identify potential conflicts  with the IBM Network Reserved IPs (Applicable to Direct Link 1.0 only)**. \n When selecting to use Direct Link, it is recommended that most customers choose Direct Link 2.0 since it provides more options and flexibility.  If you have a real need for Direct Link 1.0, make sure to review the list of IBM Network Reserved IPs that may conflict with your on-premises environment. [Learn more](/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges){: external}.    |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Coordinate with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Design Engineering when you have special requirements**. \n If you are planning on using  any of the following:  GRE or IPSec tunnels, BCR pairing,  multi VLAN tenants, custom inbound or outbound ACLs, ASN pre-pend, and static routes, open a Support ticket and request assistance from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Design Engineering to confirm your requirements are inline with your Direct Link selections.  |

| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Configure access groups**. \n You can configure, control, and manage data that is available to users in your account by configuring groups in the logging instance. Groups provide additional security by only allowing users to see a subset of auditing events, as opposed to all auditing events that are generated in the account. For example, you could grant a group of users access to only see auditing events that are related to development services in the account. Learn more by reviewing the following documentation topics: [Using groups to control data access](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-group_data_access) && [RBAC, groups and IAM integration](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-iam_grant_group){: external}.  |
| ![Checklist](images/checklist-hidden/checklist.svg)  | **Configure logging agent**. \n The logging agent collects and forwards logs to your {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} instance.
