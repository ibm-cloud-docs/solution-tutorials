## Objectives
{: #deployable-architecture-trusted-profile-objectives}

* Makes statements on what developers will learn/achieve - not what will they do Solutions and Tasks
* Short and informational (do not use sentences)

## Before you begin
{: #deployable-architecture-trusted-profile-prereqs}

This tutorial requires:
* An {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} [billable account](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts)

You will find instructions to download and install these tools for your operating environment in the [Getting started with solution tutorials](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-tutorials) guide.


To avoid the installation of these tools you can use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}}](/shell) from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

## Create a deployable architecture
{: #deployable-architecture-trusted-profile-create-da}
{: step}

create a DA from an existing solution or app template
- what is needed (prereqs) to create the DA
- what are the steps
- walk through them


## Add deployable architecture to private catalog
{: #deployable-architecture-trusted-profile-add-da-catalog}
{: step}

add the DA to a private catalog
- walk through the steps
- compliance and security aspects



## Deploy from catalog
{: #deployable-architecture-trusted-profile-deploy-da}
{: step}

deploy the DA from the private catalog
- create the trusted profile
- set up the privileges, what are the best practices
- deploy

## Manage resources
{: #deployable-architecture-trusted-profile-manage-resources}
{: step}

- What resources are created for all the steps above?
- When and how can they be deleted?



## Remove resources
{: #deployable-architecture-trusted-profile-removeresources}
{: step}

Steps to take to remove the resources created in this tutorial

Depending on the resource it might not be deleted immediately, but retained (by default for 7 days). You can reclaim the resource by deleting it permanently or restore it within the retention period. See this document on how to [use resource reclamation](/docs/account?topic=account-resource-reclamation).
