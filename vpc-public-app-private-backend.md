1. The user does this
2. Then that

## Before you begin
{: #prereqs}

1. Install all the necessary command line (CLI) tools by [following these steps](https://{DomainName}/docs/cli/index.html#overview).

## Create SSH key

## Create a VPC

## Backend

### Create a subnet for the databases
1. 10.0.10.0/24

### Create a database vm
1. use small cpu/mem
1. ubuntu
1. select ssh key

??? how to connect to the vm to install software? can I vpn with the softlayer vpn? or do I need to setup a vpn for the VPC? and if so, show the VPN on the architecture diagram

### Configure network rules for the backend subnet
1. allow incoming connections from frontend subnet on the database port
1. only one the database port
1. ssh access from within the VPC (no public ssh)

## Frontend

### Create a subnet for the frontend
1. 10.0.5.0/24

### Create a frontend vm
1. use small cpu/mem
1. ubuntu
1. select ssh key

### Configure network rules for the frontend subnet
1. allow incoming connections on port 80 and 443
1. allow outgoing connections to 10.0.10.0/24 on the database port
1. ssh access from within the VPC (no public ssh)

### Give the frontend vm a public IP so that it can be access from the Internet

### Add a public gateway so that frontend and backend can access the Internet
