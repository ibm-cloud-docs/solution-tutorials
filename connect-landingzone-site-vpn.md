# Connect a VPC landing zone to a network by using a site-to-site VPN
{: #connect-landingzone-site-vpn}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="vpc, virtual-servers"}
{: toc-completion-time="1h"}

In this tutorial, you use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}} to connect your VPC landing zone deployable architectures securely to an on-premises network through a site-to-site VPN tunnel. You configure a strongSwan VPN gateway to connect to {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}}.
{: shortdesc}

strongSwan is an open source IPsec-based VPN solution. For more information about strongSwan, see [Introduction to strongSwan](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/howtos/introduction.html){: external}.

## Objectives
{: #solution-connect-site-vpn-objectives}

You deployed one of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} landing zone deployable architectures, like [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on VPC landing zone](https://{DomainName}/catalog/architecture/deploy-arch-ibm-slz-ocp-95fccffc-ae3b-42df-b6d9-80be5914d852-global?catalog_query=aHR0cHM6Ly9jbG91ZC5pYm0uY29tL2NhdGFsb2cjcmVmZXJlbmNlX2FyY2hpdGVjdHVyZQ%3D%3D){: external}, [VPC landing zone](https://{DomainName}/catalog/architecture/deploy-arch-ibm-slz-vpc-9fc0fa64-27af-4fed-9dce-47b3640ba739-global?catalog_query=aHR0cHM6Ly9jbG91ZC5pYm0uY29tL2NhdGFsb2cjcmVmZXJlbmNlX2FyY2hpdGVjdHVyZQ%3D%3D){: external} or [VSI on VPC landing zone](https://{DomainName}/catalog/architecture/deploy-arch-ibm-slz-vsi-ef663980-4c71-4fac-af4f-4a510a9bcf68-global?catalog_query=aHR0cHM6Ly9jbG91ZC5pYm0uY29tL2NhdGFsb2cjcmVmZXJlbmNlX2FyY2hpdGVjdHVyZQ%3D%3D){: external}. The virtual servers are created and working correctly.

By default, network access to the VPC landing zone topology is locked down for security compliance reasons, so you can't access the management or workload VSIs. How can you deploy your application in the workload VSIs that are located in the workload VPC?

The answer is by assigning operator access through the Management VPC. You have several options to give operator access, with varying levels of security, compliance, and ease of enablement.

- [Client to Site with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPN Server and VPN Client](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview) - Configure a VPN client application on your device to create a secure connection to your VPC network that uses {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPN server. The VPN server service has a high availability mode for production use and is managed by IBM.
- [Site to Site VPC VPN Gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&interface=cli) - Configure your on-premises VPN to connect to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPN Gateway by using a statically route-based VPN or a policy-based VPN to set up an IPsec site-to-site tunnel between your VPC and your on-premises private network or another VPC.
- [{{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-end-to-end-private-connectivity-vpe&interface=cli) - You can establish a direct network connection between your on-premises network and {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}}.
- [Access from another VPC by using {{site.data.keyword.tg_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-end-to-end-private-connectivity-vpe&interface=cli) - Access from another {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} to your VPC can be achieved by using {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}.

 -->

In this tutorial, we can learn on how to set up a site-to-site VPN connection to your on-premises network.

## Before you begin
{: #solution-connect-site-vpn-prereqs}

- Deploy an instance of a VPC landing zone deployable architecture. For more information, see [Deploying a landing zone deployable architecture](/docs/secure-infrastructure-vpc?topic=secure-infrastructure-vpc-deploy).
- Create a VSI with any Linux-based OS in different Virtual Private Cloud(VPC), subnet, with default ACL rules, and a security group that allows SSH access. Make sure that the VSI is assigned a floating IP, which is used for SSH access to the machine. To simulate an on-premises network, these steps assume that a VSI is deployed onto a separate VPC.

The tutorial is based on the following assumptions:

- The operating system is CentOS. For more information about other VPN configurations, see [Configuring the on-premises VPN gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-onprem-example#configuring-onprem-gateway).
- The VPN gateway is deployed on a landing zone VPC that is named `management-vpc`.
- Your deployable architecture includes a VSI in `management-vpc` that is supported by the VSI on VPC landing zone deployable architecture in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

## Set up Strongswan
{: #strongswan-setup}
{: step}

For more information about how to install strongSwan on an operating system other than CentOS, see the [installation documentation](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/install/install.html).{: external}
{: tip}

1.  Enable IP forwarding:
    1.  Open the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file in a text editor and add the following line:

        ```text
        net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    1.  Save and close the file.
    1.  Apply the changes with the following command:

        ```sh
        sudo sysctl -p
        ```
        {: pre}

1.  Install strongSwan:

    ```sh
    sudo dnf install epel-release -y
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    sudo dnf install strongswan -y
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  Start the strongSwan service and enable it to start at system startup:

    ```sh
    systemctl start strongswan
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    systemctl enable strongswan
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    systemctl status strongswan
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  Configure security gateways:
    1.  Open the `/etc/strongswan/ipsec.conf` file:

        In the following example, a connection is defined between the on-premises subnet `10.160.x.x/26` with the IP address `169.45.x.x` for the strongSwan VPN gateway and the deployable architecture VPN gateway and management VSI subnets `10.10.30.0/24,10.20.10.0/24` with a {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}} gateway IP address `169.61.x.x`.

        ```text
         conn all
             type=tunnel
             auto=start
             esp=aes256-sha256!
             ike=aes256-sha256-modp2048!
             left=%any
             leftsubnet=10.160.x.x/26                    #<== c. Subnet CIDR of your on-premises network
             rightsubnet=10.10.30.0/24,10.20.10.0/24     #<== d, e. Subnet CIDR of the deployable architecture VPN gateway. Subnet CIDR of the Management VSI
             right=169.61.x.x                            #<== f. Public IP of the VPN gateway
             leftauth=psk
             rightauth=psk
             leftid="169.45.x.x"                         #<== g. Public IP of your strongSwan server
             keyexchange=ikev2
             lifetime=10800s
             ikelifetime=36000s
             dpddelay=30s
             dpdaction=restart
             dpdtimeout=120s
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    1.  Click the **Navigation menu** icon ![Navigation menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu"), and then click **VPC Infrastructure** > **Virtual server instances** from the **Compute** section.
    1.  Specify the subnet of your on-premises network:
        1.  Select the VSI that has the strongSwan gateway installed.
        1.  In the **Network Interfaces** section, click the subnet name of the interface that has the floating IP assigned to it.
        1.  Copy the subnet IP range of your on-premises network to the `leftsubnet` property in the `ipsec.conf` file.
    1.  Specify the CIDR of the management VSI:
        1.  Click **Subnets** in the **Network** section to open the Subnets for VPC page.
        1.  Search for subnets associated with the management VPC (in our example, `management-vpc`).
        1.  From the list of subnets, click the subnet name with the management VSI deployed.
        1.  Copy the subnet IP range column to the `rightsubnet` property in the `ipsec.conf` file.
    1.  Specify the CIDRs of the landing zone VPN gateway:
        1.  Click **VPNs** in the **Network** section to open the VPNs for VPC page.
        1.  Make sure that the **Site-to-site gateways** > **VPN gateways** tabs are selected.
        1.  Select the site-to-site VPN associated with your landing zone deployable architecture (in our example, `management-gateway`).
        1.  On the VPN gateway details page, click **Subnet** to see details about the subnet associated with your VPN gateway.
        1.  Copy the subnet IP range column of the deployable architecture VPN gateway.

            Copy the IP range to the beginning of the `rightsubnet` property in the `ipsec.conf` file. Separate this range from the CIDR of the management VSI with a comma, as shown in the example.
    1.  Specify the public IP address of the VPN gateway:
        1.  On the VPNs for VPC page, make sure that the **Site-to-site gateways** > **VPN gateways** tabs are selected.
        1.  Select the site-to-site VPN associated with your landing zone deployable architecture again (in our example, `management-gateway`).
        1.  In the VPN gateway details page, click any Public IP to copy it and paste it in the `right` property in the `ipsec.conf` file.
    1.  Verify the public IP of your strongSwan server:
        - Click **Virtual server instances** in the **Compute** section.
        - Click the name of the VSI that has the strongSwan gateway installed.
        - Click the Floating IP that is associated with the subnet you chose in the Step 1 in the **Network Interfaces** section.
        - Paste the IP address in the `leftid` property to identify the IP address of the strongSwan server.
1.  Configure a pre-shared key (PSK) for peer-to-peer authentication.
    1.  On the command line, issue the following command to generate a strong PSK for the peers to use:

        ```sh
        head -c 24 /dev/urandom | base64
        ```
        {: pre}

    1.  Add the PSK to the `/etc/strongswan/ipsec.secrets` file.

        ```text
        # <Public IP of your strongSwan server> <Public IP of the Landing Zone VPN gateway> : PSK "***********"
        169.45.x.x  169.61.x.x : PSK "***********"
        ```
        {: codeblock}

1.  Start the strongSwan service and check the status of connections.

    ```sh
    systemctl restart strongswan
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    ❯ strongswan status
      Security Associations (0 up, 1 connecting):
            all[1]: CONNECTING, 10.160.x.x[%any]...169.61.x.x[%any]
    ```
    {: screen}

    It's normal for the status to show '0 up, 1 connecting' because the connection on the landing zone side is not yet set up.

    ```
    {: pre}

## Test the site-to-site gateway setup
{: #test-connection}
{: step}

Follow these steps to verify that you have a working site-to-site gateway.

1.  Access the strongSwan VSI. On your computer, issue the following command on the command line:

    ```sh
    ssh -i <private-key> root@<Floating IP of strongswan VSI>
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  Access the management VSI by completing the following steps:
    1.  Go to **Virtual server instances** for VPC. Copy the private IP (“Reserved IP”) for the VSI that's labeled `<management-server-2>` (10.20.10.4 in this example).
    1.  On the strongSwan VSI, ping the management VSI.

       ```sh
       ❯ ping 10.20.10.4
       PING 10.20.10.4 (10.20.10.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
